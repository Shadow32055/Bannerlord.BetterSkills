## Installation & Updating
1. Download the mod.
2. Copy the mod folder into your Bannerlord Modules folder, generally located at _C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules_.
3. Unblock all dllâ€™s under the mod folder.
4. (Optional) If not using MCM, configure the mod via the config.xml located in the mod folder (after launching the game once).

For updating please delete the mod folder and follow the installation process again.
If you're using MCM, your previous settings will be remembered. If not, you'll have to configure these again.

## Configuration
### Mod Configuration Menu
Configuration is done in game via Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) or via config.xml to keep requirements down.
Make sure to adjust your config to suit your taste. The default values are fairly balanced, but everyone has their own preferences.

### Configuration without MCM
If you're not using MCM, the config.xml file is located in the mod folder. It will automatically be created after running the game with the mod enabled. Close the game, change the settings to your liking and launch the game again.

## FAQs
**Is Better Attributes save game compatible?**

Better Attributes can safely be added to an ongoing save game.
It should be safe to remove from a save, but you should always backup your save before attempting any game/save modification.

**I'm not using Mod Configuration Menu (MCM), where is the config.xml?**

The config.xml file is created at runtime. Thus, you will need to launch the game once after installing the mod for the config.xml to generate. The config.xml will then be located in the root of the mod folder, generally located at _C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\BetterAttributes_.

**I found a bug/issue, what should I do?**
